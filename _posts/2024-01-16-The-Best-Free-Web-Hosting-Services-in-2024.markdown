## Introduction
Web hosting has come a long way in recent years. Where once free hosting meant severely limited features and unreliable uptime, there are now many excellent free hosting options that give you everything you need to build a basic website. In this post, I'll review the top free web hosting providers and help you determine which one is the best fit for your needs.

### The Free Hosting Landscape Has Changed 
The free web hosting landscape has evolved significantly over the past decade. Companies now offer generous free hosting plans to attract new customers who may eventually upgrade to paid plans. While free plans have limitations compared to paid hosting, the features offered go well beyond what was previously available. Most free hosts now provide sufficient resources like storage, bandwidth, databases and basic email for simple personal websites and blogs.

### Factors to Consider
When choosing a free web host, it's important to evaluate factors like available resources, supported technologies, ease of use, reliability, and customer support. Consider your site's needs in terms of expected traffic and content volume. Also think about what tools and technologies you require, such as a content management system (CMS) like WordPress. Review independent hosting reviews to verify uptime and performance scores. Your choice will depend on balancing all these considerations within the feature constraints of free plans.

However, limitations include a lack of email accounts, subdomains, and SSL certificates. Technical support is provided through community help forums rather than dedicated phone or ticket support. Still, for the basic features it supplies, 000Webhost remains a suitable free option for very simple personal sites.
