## Recommended Piano Plugins ###

Keyzone Classic lives up to its name by offering realistic grand piano samples. With three mic positions to mix and dynamic response that feels natural, it fools even discerning players. Great for complex classical pieces or more basic arrangement needs in any genre. Its attention to detail elevates mockups or helps flesh out demos.

## Recommended Compressor Plugins ###  

ADHD is a versatile plugin that lets you shape the character of your sounds. Beyond basic gain reduction, it colors signals with warm saturation. The three modes each apply it differently for creative coloration. Great when you want movement or improved perception without sacrificing the original timbre. 

Molot is simplicity itself but delivers the pleasing character compressors became known for. With controls based on hardware classics, it reacts organically to transients and breathing room. Fine for adding cohesion across a mix or enhancing individual instruments naturally. Its warmth enhances without distortion.

FR-CAP87 emulates the dynamics processing of iconic units with strict minimalism. Just four parameters operate onboard, hiding complexity for focused, minimal gain reduction. Perfect for utility functions like sustaining basslines or drums without altering signatures. Minimal but effective for functionality over coloration needs.

## Recommended EQ Plugins ###

TDR Nova gives the precision of analog graphic EQs. Its 31 interactive bands allow surgical filtering down to narrow problem frequencies. Bell and shelving options add flexibility. Interface improvements like band linking increase usability. Great for difficult mixes, matching room tone, or precision carving of individual elements. 

Voxengo Marvel is the Swiss Army knife of EQs. Its linear phase design removes alteration artifacts, useful for delicate corrections or complex layering. Toolsets like spectral analyzer and matched filters solve issues efficiently. Ideal for serious correction or precise adjustments across a project without phase distortion side effects.

## Recommended Distortion Plugins ###

CamelCrusher bestows the warmth of hardware in software. Models of classic stompboxes impart character through four algorithms. Beyond drive, tone shaping and clipping options provide subtler control over grain, presence and harmonic overtones. Imparts personality to any source naturally, from synthetic saturation to tube driven roar.

VOX Amplification plug-ins channel real amp tone. The AC30 emulates the British voices that defined rock. Mic placements, ambient miking and cabinet resonance recreate the three-dimensional soundstage that elevated recordings.

Klanghelm IVGI brings the smoothness of analog without harsh digitization. A subtle saturator, it gently enhances frequencies for a cohesive mix. Three types of distortion impart more controlled warmth than harshness. Preserves transients and fidelity while lending fullness, punching up synths, drums or layered elements.

## Recommended Other Effects Plugins ###

OTT became ubiquitous due to transparent multidimensional enhancement. Multiband processing increases gain differentially, raising perceived volume without distorting balance or clarity. Ideal for livening mixes through attention-grabbing transient push without coloring sound signatures. Simple, clean and powerful enhancement. 

NI Supercharger increases perceived impact through makeup gain. Taking dynamics processing to an extreme, it emphasizes attack transiently using multistage compression. Useful for ensuring elements cut through dense mixes where peak limiting hinders punch. Preserves tone while lending energy and slam.

## Recommended Reverb Plugins ###

TAL Reverb-II emulates the lush resonance of classic studio plates. Four algorithms authentically model varied hardware for an enveloping ambient sheen. Natural reverberation textures breaths life into tracks without clutter. Great for glueing mixes together or evolving mono sources spatially. 

Oril River blurs the line between hall and plate reverbs. Hybrid algorithms lend natural depth and resonance without harsh reflections. Fine tuning of parameter ranges from lush to subtle. Ideal for smoothing out elements organically within a mix or adding ambient presence on the cheap.

## Plugins for Audio to MIDI Conversion ###

Blue Cat's FreqAnalyst Pro deconstructs audio into note parameters like MIDI. Multiband spectral analysis isolates fundamental pitches for extraction to MIDI, detection of beats for tempo tracking, and separation of polyphonic parts. Export options include MIDI, MusicXML and notation formats to integrate analysis back into productions or notation software.

Melodyne takes audio editing further. Precise pitch detection allows microtuning and formant shifting of single notes or complete phrases. Flexible MIDI export and audio healing keep timing and envelopes natural. Capable of advanced manipulation likenote sliding or vibrato to replicate instrumental nuance for realism. Supported formats include most sample rates and bit depths.

With the abundance of great free VST plugins, limited budgets need not be an obstacle to high quality music production. Carefully picked tools across key categories like synthesis, effects and utilities can get results on par with expensive plugins. Proper gain staging with these plugins allows impressive, professional quality sound without breaking the bank.
