## Choosing the Right CPU
### Introduction of the two popular CPU brands: AMD and Intel
AMD and Intel are the two dominant CPU manufacturers in the PC gaming market. AMD offers excellent value with their Ryzen series CPUs. The Ryzen 3xxx, 5xxx and 7xxx series implement the company’s latest “Zen” microarchitecture and are highly competitive for gaming across different price points. On the other hand, Intel’s Core processors deliver strong single-core performance, with the Core i5 and Core i7 CPUs being the main options for budget gaming rigs.

### Description of common CPU series for gaming: AMD Ryzen 3/5/7/9 and Intel Core i3/i5/i7/i9   
AMD's Ryzen 3 CPUs are affordable quad-core options great for entry-level gaming. The Ryzen 5 lineup provides strong multi-core performance on a slight budget. Stepping up to a Ryzen 7 offers advanced capabilities like simultaneous multi-threading. The flagship Ryzen 9 CPUs pack 8 cores or more. Meanwhile, Intel's Core i3 chips deliver decent dual-core functionality for less intensive games. Core i5 CPUs are fantastic mid-range picks with quad cores. Opting for a Core i7 upgrades you to 6 cores while i9 chips lead Intel's mainstream offering with 8 cores or higher.

### Recommendation: Ryzen 5 for high-end gaming or Ryzen 7 if streaming; Core i5 or i7 equivalents
For high-end gaming on a tight budget, a Ryzen 5 CPU like the 3600 is an outstanding choice. It has 6 cores/12 threads and easily handles demanding games. If you plan to stream, a Ryzen 7 such as the 3700X gives you that extra headroom. If going Intel, a Core i5-10400F is a solid budget choice for gaming only, while a Core i7-10700K is strong if also doing multicore tasks.

## Selecting the Perfect Graphics Card   
### Introduction of the two GPU brands: AMD and NVIDIA
Much like CPUs, AMD and NVIDIA dominate the discrete GPU industry. AMD's Radeon cards provide great value, often matching NVIDIA's performance for less money. That said, NVIDIA's GeForce GPUs are renowned stability and supported features like ray tracing. Both are perfectly viable choices depending on budgets and needs.

### Overview of AMD RX series: RX VEGA, 500, and 5000 series
AMD's modern RX5000 series delivers outstanding performance and efficiency. The RX 5600 XT flies through 1080p gaming, while the RX 5700 XT is ideal for 1440p. Previously, the RX 500 lineup like the 580 brought great 1080p gaming on modest budgets. The older Vega cards could also handle esports titles well when prices dropped. 

### Overview of NVIDIA GTX and RTX series: 10, 16, 20 series
NVIDIA's massively popular GTX 1060 gave smooth 1080p gameplay for many builds. The subsequent GTX 1650 and 1660 deliver refined Pascal architecture. For higher resolution gaming, the RTX 2060 excels at 1440p, while the 2070 can even handle 4K in some titles. Meanwhile, the affordability of the 1650 and 1660 Ti makes them superb 1080p options.

### Recommendation: RX 5600XT for 1080p Ultra, RX 5700XT for 1440p; GTX 1660Ti for 1080p, RTX 2060 for 1440p
The RX 5600 XT crushes 1080p gaming on max settings. For an affordable 1440p GPU, the RX 5700 XT has fantastic value. At 1080p, the versatile GTX 1660 Ti handles most games with ease. And stepping up to the RTX 2060 brings powerful 1440p gameplay.

## Choosing the Right Motherboard and RAM
### Important factors to consider when selecting a motherboard: Socket type, chipset, features   
The CPU socket (AM4 for AMD, LGA1200 for Intel 10th Gen) must match the motherboard. Beyond that, consider the chipset (B550, X570 for AMD; Z490 for Intel), slot types, ports, and onboard features like WiFi needed. Form factor like ATX or micro-ATX also matters based on the case.

### Recommended motherboard series for different CPUs
Budget AMD builds pair well with inexpensive B550 motherboards. The MSI B550-A PRO, AsRock B550 Phantom Gaming 4/AC and Gigabyte B550M DS3H are solid options. For Intel, an H410, B460 or H470 board works great with entry Core i3/i5 CPUs. Stepping up to X570 or Z490 unlocks overclocking on high-end Ryzen or Intel chips.

### Overview of RAM: capacity, speed, types  
RAM amount matters most for gaming - 16GB should satisfy all current games. As for speed, DDR4-3200Mhz is a great sweet spot. Low latency kits like CL16 are preferred over higher latency like CL18. And look for 2x8GB dual-channel configurations for best performance.

### Recommendation: At least 16GB DDR4 3200MHz RAM
Get 2x8GB or 1x16GB of DDR4-3200 RAM with a CL of 16. This fast, low-latency setup ensures no bottlenecks in current titles whether using AMD or Intel processors within a reasonable budget. Higher capacity like 32GB isn't needed for the majority of mainstream users.

## Picking the Storage and Power Supply
### HDD vs SSD storage types and their speeds   
Hard disk drives (HDD) are inexpensive but rather slow, while solid state drives (SSD) are much quicker despite higher costs. SSDs make for noticeably snappier system performance and load times in games. 

### Overview of common SSD interfaces: SATA, M.2 NVMe, PCIe
SATA SSDs plug into the motherboard like HDDs, giving a nice boost over mechanical storage. M.2 NVMe drives featuring the PCIe interface offer the fastest read/write speeds generally, making them ideal for speed demons. Some motherboards even support both M.2 types.

### Recommendation: 256GB M.2 NVMe SSD + 1-2TB HDD  
Pair a roomy 256GB M.2 NVMe drive like the WD Blue SN550 for your operating system and key games, along with a 2TB HDD like the Seagate Barracuda for files and extra games. This hybrid approach gives you both speed and plentiful space on a budget.

### Factors to consider for power supply: wattage, rating, modularity
The power supply must exceed your estimated wattage by around 20% with overhead and have an 80 Plus efficiency rating of Bronze minimum. Modularity helps with cable management too.

### Recommendation: 80+ Gold fully modular PSU at least 200W above requirement
For quality and longevity inside a budget-focused build, an 80+ Gold modular PSU rated 200W higher delivers reliable power cleanly inside your case, like Corsair's CX650F or Cooler Master MWE Gold 650. Leave headroom for future upgrades too.

## Case and Other Peripherals
### Case size and features to match motherboard form factor
Choose a case that accommodates your motherboard's form factor - ATX, micro-ATX or mini-ITX. Consider drive bays, rad/fan mounting and extras like RGB/tempered glass. 

### Options for OS, display monitor, keyboard, mouse
Windows 10 is an obvious OS choice. As for monitors, aim for at least 1080p with a 120-144Hz refresh rate if gaming competitively. Basic peripherals like a $30 keyboard/mouse suffice for most users.

### Tips on cable management
Invest 15 minutes to loom excess cables neatly behind the motherboard tray or wherever out of sight. It avoids clutter and improves airflow for a snazzier interior view. Velcro straps or zip ties aid the process tremendously.

## Assembly and Driver Installation
### Step-by-step assembly process with pictures
Carefully assemble the parts referring to your motherboard manual. Mount the CPU, RAM, M.2 SSD, air cooler, graphics card. Then screw in the power supply and drive bays followed by installing the I/O shield.  

### Guidance on BIOS, Windows installation and driver updates  
When booted, navigate the BIOS menus and enable XMP for fast RAM if needed. Install Windows 10 via USB drive. Download chipset, GPU and other important drivers online, including Windows important updates.

## Benchmarking and Optimization    
### Benchmarking with synthetic and games tests
Run benchmarks like 3DMark, Cinebench and games to evaluate performance versus expectations. Monitor temps while stress testing. Results help determine overclocking headroom if desired later on.

### Optimization techniques: applications autostart, graphics settings
Tweak windows settings like disabling unnecessary startup apps. For games, optimize visual settings to balance visuals and high frame rates within your hardware's limits for smooth gameplay.
