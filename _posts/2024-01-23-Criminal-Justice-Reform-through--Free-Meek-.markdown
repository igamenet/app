## Shedding Light on Systemic Injustices
Meek Mill's experience with the criminal justice system, as depicted in the documentary "Free Meek", highlights systemic injustices that disproportionately impact people of color. The documentary illustrated problems with the probation system through Meek Mill's case. After numerous minor violations, the judge overseeing his probation case chose to give him a harsh 2-4 year prison sentence for things as minor as popping a wheelie on a dirt bike. This type of excessive punishment for trivial probation violations shows how easily individuals can become trapped in an unfair system. The documentary also brought to light racial biases within the justice system through statistics showing that black Americans are much more likely to receive unfairly long sentences for minor drug crimes or probation violations compared to their white counterparts.

### Catalyzing Discussions on Reform
By telling Meek Mill's personal story, "Free Meek" became a platform to advocate for meaningful changes to the criminal justice system. The documentary sparked nationwide debates around issues like probation reform, sentencing guidelines, and mass incarceration. Viewers were outraged by Meek Mill's case and wanted to see an end to judges having so much individual discretion over probation sentencing without clear rules or oversight. There were also calls to reevaluate drug crime sentencing policies that have led to the disproportionate incarceration of black and brown Americans. Overall, the movie fueled necessary discussions on how to make the justice system fairer and prevent others from enduring similar injustices.
