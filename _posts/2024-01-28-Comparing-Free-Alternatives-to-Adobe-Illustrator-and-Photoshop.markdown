### Free vs Paid Options 
Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop are popular paid options but cost money beyond a 7-day trial. Inkscape and GIMP are free open source options though limited compared to paid software. Affinity Designer and Photo offer good value as affordable one-time purchases that provide capable alternatives on par with paid software.

### Online and Browser-Based Tools
Figma, Pixlr and Gravity Designer allow creating vector graphics directly in a web browser. Figma exports to SVG freely while Pixlr has powerful tools though limiting without an upgrade. Online options provide accessibility without downloads but trading flexibility for features compared to desktop software.

### Desktop Alternatives  
Inkscape remains a capable free Illustrator alternative for Windows and Linux users. The learning curve takes effort to handle complex tasks though resources exist to help new users. Krita focuses on raster graphics and digital painting over vectors but supports both.

### Emerging Contenders
Affinity Designer offers nearly the same vector capabilities as Illustrator for a low $50 purchase. Affinity Photo provides photo editing abilities close to Photoshop. Autodesk Sketchbook continues growing its free drawing and painting tools adopted by professionals. 

### Specialized Apps
Vectr remains ideal for newcomers with simplicity yet powerful vector graphics creation online or offline. Medibang Paint includes tools tailored for manga and anime artwork alongside an active art community.

### Tips for Specific Tasks   
Illustrator excels at color accuracy and precision drawing useful for graphics, engineering or CAD work. Inkscape handles complex snapping better than Illustrator for technical drawings. Pixlr Photo streamlines photo edits directly from Google Photos with layers and effects.

### Factors to Consider  
Choosing depends on skill level, project needs, industry standard support, pricing models and whether flexibility outweighs limited but free features. Paid software trades flexibility for ongoing costs versus affordable one-time purchases.

### Emerging Contenders Revisited
Amadine app remains in beta development actively gathering user feedback to refine its interface for accessible learning. Apple doesn't directly customize interfaces but alternative files can modify appearance independent of paid software company policies. 

### Supporting Software Developers  
While free options provide accessibility, paid software requires substantial development costs deserving consideration. Short term free trials help evaluate before purchasing capable alternatives that support continued improvements.
