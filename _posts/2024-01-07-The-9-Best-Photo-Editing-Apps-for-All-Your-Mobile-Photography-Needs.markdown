### Snapseed Brings Non-Destructive Editing and Selective Adjustments 
Snapseed sets itself apart with non-destructive editing, allowing you to try out different filters and adjustments without permanently altering your original photos.

You can even download and edit RAW files directly within the app for maximum control over your photos. Snapseed remains one of the best all-around photo editors for both casual use and serious post-processing.

### Lightroom Pioneered the Camera Roll Editing Experience
Adobe Lightroom was one of the original apps to pioneer the camera roll approach to mobile photo editing. Its intuitive interface allows you to quickly swipe between your photos, flag your favorite shots, and delete any misses. Exposure, contrast, highlights, shadows, and other image parameters are all adjustable with sliders for granular control. Built-in presets and filters apply different looks to your photos in an instant. You can even export your edited shots as high-resolution JPEGs ready to share or print. Lightroom excels at quickly editing and organizing large batches of photos on the go.

Beyond basic adjustments for light, color, and warmth, Polarr offers more advanced tools ideal for portraits, landscapes, and other genres. Heal skin blemishes or straighten tilted horizons with just a tap. Over 30 built-in filters emulate different film styles, from grainy 127 film to faded Polaroids. Where Polarr truly shines is its thoughtfully designed interface clearly laid out for studio-quality edits. Advanced sliders and controls put serious retouching power in your hands whether you're an amateur or professional.

### PicsArt Empowers User Creativity With Collages, Filters, and More

Beginners and pros alike will appreciate PicsArt’s balance of usability and capabilities for unleashing your creative vision.

### Afterlight Focuses on Film Presets and Refinement Tools  
Afterlight strikes a balance as a photo editor tailored for both casual use and precision tweaks. Presets expertly emulate popular film stocks to transform images with authentic analog flair. Adjustment layers also allow non-destructively tweaking specific tonal ranges like shadows, highlights, or colors. Where Afterlight truly shines compared to competitors though are its sliders for fine-tuning light, clarity, textures and other subtle image parameters. Whether recreating nostalgic films or subtly polishing smartphone photos, Afterlight delivers.

### VSCO Inspires Creativity With Presets From Pro Photographers
VSCO stands for Visual Supply Company and focuses on presets crafted by award-winning photographers to inspire your creativity. Pre-made presets transform the entire look and feel of photos with a single tap. You can also start from scratch and finely tune exposures, colors, and styles on your own. Community-shared presets allow discovering new looks from other photographers as well. Cross-processing simulations expertly blend colors for dreamy analog-inspired edits ideal for portraiture and landscapes. VSCO remains a top choice for those seeking artistic inspiration above technical controls.

### Canva Goes Beyond Photos Into Graphics and Layouts  
While many editors focus only on photos, Canva takes a more well-rounded approach to visual content creation.
