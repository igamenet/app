### The History and Theory Behind Free Trade
Free trade has never truly existed due to issues like unstable currencies and determination of prices outside global markets. During periods dubbed free trade eras, competition actually manifested in imperfect forms like oligopoly rather than the theoretical perfect competition model. Perfect competition remains hypothetical while imperfect market structures such as monopoly reflect economic realities.

### Differing Perspectives on the Concept
Supporters argue free trade lifts prosperity by enabling commerce without tariffs between nations with varying resources. However, critics assert free trade incentivizes offshoring jobs to exploit cheaper overseas labor, endangering domestic employment and national security. Reasonable people disagree on this complex issue with arguments on both sides.

### Market Forces and Structures Shape Competition
Perfect competition appears infrequently in reality while oligopolistic and monopolistically competitive industries featuring fewer players and product differentiation are widespread. The nature of competition depends heavily on prevalent market structures and the regulatory environment in each nation and sector.

### Regional Trading Arrangements
The European Union's single market and customs union encompass the most participating nations and economic output. Other sizable agreements involve Australia and China, South American Mercosur nations, and North American Canada and the US. Regional accords illustrate attempts to liberalize trade between willing partners.

### Criticism of the Ideal of Perfect Free Trade  
Supporters of free trade ignore that corporations relocate operations overseas primarily to access dirt-cheap labor, not comparative advantage. Realistically, true free trade remains unattainable since economies differ in development and countries prioritize domestic stakeholders. Protectionism backfires but perfection remains elusive.

### Responding to Criticisms of Liberalized Trade
As demonstrated by tariffs exacerbating the Great Depression, isolationism causes more damage than benefit. Rather than restricting commerce, balanced cooperation between interested governments and policies ensuring the population shares gains offer wise approaches.

### China and the Prospects for True Free Trade  
Since China maintains significant controls on socio-political and economic freedoms incompatible with free markets, authentic free trade with China proves impossible. A pragmatic strategy balancing national interests may work better than chasing an unfeasible ideal with an authoritarian state.  

### Utopian Dreams Meet Practical Constraints
While absolutely unrestricted trade could devastate many developing nations' autonomy, countries also reasonably impose standards and prohibit things like weapons for stability. No system accommodates every idealistic goal due to tradeoffs between ethics and complex realities.

### Navigating Competing Interests and Priorities  
Pure free trade or other perfect models remain utopian given economics, geopolitics and human impacts. Prudent policymaking weighs principles against practical necessities to balance societal, economic and geopolitical factors in evolving, interdependent times. Open dialogue and compromise present the wisest path forward on this debate lacking an easy solution.
