### What is Sourdough?
Sourdough has been used for thousands of years as the traditional method of leavening bread before the advent of commercial yeast. Sourdough uses a culture of wild yeasts and bacteria known as a SCOBY (symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast) that is formed and maintained through a process of regularly refreshing flour and water. This SCOBY imparts complex flavors over the long fermentation period which can last anywhere from 12-24 hours. In contrast, modern breads made with commercial yeast often rely on fast fermentation times of only a few hours, sacrificing much of the nuanced sourdough flavor.

### Gluten in Wheat Flour
The protein gluten, found predominantly in wheat flour, plays a key role in creating bread with an airy texture. During the kneading process, gluten strands develop an elastic network that traps gas produced by yeast during fermentation. This allows the bread to rise and maintain its shape once baked. Without sufficient gluten development, bread would be dense and heavy instead of light and airy.

### Making Sourdough Bread 
To make sourdough bread, a starter must first be created by regularly "feeding" wild yeasts and bacteria flour and water over the course of 7-10 days. This forms the SCOBY that will be used to leaven the bread. The starter is mixed into a dough along with more flour, water, and salt. Advanced bakers may experiment with varying the hydration level of the dough which influences the texture of the final crumb. Kneading, rising, shaping, and baking techniques can also be modified to achieve different flavors and textures.

### Differences from Commercial Yeast Bread
While both sourdough and commercial yeast breads rely on the gases produced by microbial activity to rise, there are some key differences. Sourdough uses a culture that has developed over long fermentation to create complex sour and acidic flavors not found in breads made with fast-acting commercial yeast. Commercial yeast prefers a much faster production cycle better suited for mass production, though it cannot match the nuanced taste of traditionally fermented sourdough. 

### Gluten during Fermentation
During the fermentation process, yeast consume sugars present in the flour but do not significantly break down gluten proteins. This allows the elastic gluten network formed during kneading to remain intact, giving the finished bread its characteristic soft crumb texture. Interestingly, the type of leavening used, whether a SCOBY starter culture or commercial yeast, does not seem to impact the levels of gluten in the final product.

### Conclusions on Gluten
In summary, gluten plays a vital structural role in both sourdough and commercial yeast breads. Its elastic protein strands trap gas during rising and retain air pockets in the baked loaf. Although different microbial cultures are used, the fermentation process itself does not degrade gluten content. Both types of artisanal bread can provide gluten to a similar degree for those who require or enjoy it in their diet. In the end, personal taste often dictates preferences around traditional sourdough versus other leavened breads.
