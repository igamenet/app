## The Giants Value Bumgarner Too Much

The Giants see Bumgarner as the cornerstone of their rotation for years to come. Though injuries have limited him to just 7 starts so far in 2019, when healthy he remains one of the best left-handed starters in baseball. His affordable contract that keeps him under team control through 2021 is extremely valuable for the Giants. As a small market team, they simply cannot afford to lose an impact player of Bumgarner's caliber without receiving a massive haul in return. 

### Bumgarner's Injury History Will Not Scare Off the Giants

While Bumgarner's dirt bike accident in 2017 and recent liner off the bat injury caused brief scares, the Giants know these were just flukes and not related to his pitching arm. Both times he suffered non-throwing injuries that did not impact the health of his shoulder or elbow. As one of the most durable starters in baseball prior to the mishaps, Bumgarner has proven his ability to make 30+ starts year after year. The Giants trust that he will rebound to form the second half once fully recovered from the latest bruise.

## The Yankees Cannot Meet the Giants' Sky-High Asking Price  

It is no secret that the Yankees desperately want to add an impact starter to solidify their rotation for a playoff push. But their desire has only increased the price tag demanded by the Giants. With multiple contenders expected to inquire, San Francisco will seek the type of massive, franchise-altering return usually only seen in trades for true superstars. A package headlined by top prospects like Justus Sheffield may still not be enough. The Yankees would have to empty much of their farm system and take on salary in other problematic contracts. Such a hefty cost simply does not make financial or organizational sense.

## The NL West Arms Race Makes a Trade Less Likely

With the tight NL West race featuring the big-spending Dodgers and surging Padres, the Giants have even more incentive to cling to Bumgarner. As one of the faces of the franchise and a homegrown star, trading him to a division rival would enrage the fanbase. The Giants want to battle their competitors with their full arsenal intact. They also seek to maintain payroll flexibility by keeping Bumgarner's team-friendly contract on the books. Dealing him aids opponents while hurting the Giants' ability to contend now and in the future.

## The Yankees Rotation Woes Demand Reinforcements  

Despite a hot first half, injuries have taken a major toll on the Yankees rotation. Most notably, Jordan Montgomery's Tommy John surgery created a hole that internal options like Domingo German or Chance Adams may not adequately fill. Adding another arm with Bumgarner's resume of reliability and big-game experience has become an absolute necessity. However, with the Giants unwilling to assist enemies, the market will not easily yield an impact starter of Bumgarner's caliber who makes financial and long-term sense for the Yankees.

## Securing Bumgarner Requires Outbidding All Competitors

Knowing that contenders across both leagues seek starting pitching, the Yankees face steep competition. Teams like the Astros, Brewers, and Phillies all aim higher than middle-of-the-rotation rentals. If the Giants do make Bumgarner available, an all-out war between suitors will drive up his price to unprecedented levels. Outmatching multiple deep-pocketed franchises desperate for an October difference maker is no easy task. More realistic mid-rotation targets presenting less risk of a bidding war may make more sense.

## Alternatives Offer Less Upside and Control  

While the Yankees scour for alternatives, the pickings remain slim. Middle prospects like Marcus Stroman, Mike Minor and more present rotational stability but lack Bumgarner's true ace pedigree and resume. Rentals fail to address the long-term gap in the rotation. None satisfy the desire for a true top-of-the-line starter who can carry the workload into October. Finding an impact arm under reasonable financial and prospects cost grows nearly impossible by the day. The alternatives fail to genuinely solve the need for a difference maker.

## Staying Put Benefits Both Bumgarner and Giants  

Trailing the first-place Dodgers by just 4.5 games as the All-Star break nears, the Giants continue fighting for their playoff lives in the competitive NL West. Now largely healthy again, Bumgarner hitting his stride strengthens that fight down the stretch. His team-friendly contract and homegrown roots make him uniquely valuable to the Giants franchise for years to come. Both sides benefit from staying united for a 2019 playoff push before reassessing the future in the offseason. The surging Giants show no signs of selling at present.  

## Fate Seals Bumgarner’s Stay in San Francisco

All signs point to MadBum remaining a Giant through the trade deadline and beyond. With the Giants in contention, his price too steep, alternatives lacking, and competition fierce, the Yankees' strong desire for his services will go unfulfilled. A blockbuster acquisition fans crave fails to materialize, keeping frustration boiling over the state of the starting rotation. As the season's second half begins, the Yankees must find answers from within to backup their lineup's dominance in October's winner-take-all games.
